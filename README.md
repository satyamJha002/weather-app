# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project's directory.
3. Install the dependencies by running `npm install` in the terminal.
4. Start the development server by running `npm run dev` in the terminal.
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.

That's it! The application should now be running locally on your machine.
